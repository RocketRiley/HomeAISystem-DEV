"""Simulated vision watcher for Clair.

This stub pretends to monitor a TV or display visible in the camera
feed.  It periodically prints a message indicating that a show or
video has been detected.  In a real system, you would integrate
computer vision or OCR here to understand what is on screen and
trigger appropriate behaviour.  Use this as a starting point for
developing your own vision integration.
