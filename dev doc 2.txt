Aegis AI: Data Security & Handler Control Philosophy
This document outlines the design philosophy for the Aegis AI Companion's data management systems. The core principle is absolute data sovereignty for the user. The AI is designed as a private, personal entity, and the user ("Handler") is given complete and transparent control over its "memories" and operational data. We reject the industry standard of centralized, developer-owned data servers.
1. Core Philosophy: The Handler Owns The Data, Period.
The relationship between a Handler and their AI is personal. Therefore, the AI's data—its learned experiences, conversation logs, and configured personality—belongs exclusively to the Handler.
No Central Servers: Aegis AI does not operate servers that store user data. There is no central "cloud" where AI memories are collected or processed.
Privacy by Design: The entire system is architected from the ground up to function in a completely offline, self-contained environment.
Data Portability: The Handler's ownership is absolute. They should be able to back up, move, or even delete their AI's entire existence at will.
2. Local-First Architecture
The Aegis AI Companion is built to be "offline-by-default."
Local Processing: All core AI logic, including natural language processing and skill execution, runs on the Handler's own hardware.
Opt-In Connectivity: The AI will never connect to the internet unless the Handler explicitly installs and configures a skill that requires an online API (e.g., a weather skill connecting to a weather service). The Handler has granular control over every external connection.
3. Handler-Directed Storage
The Handler has complete control over where their AI's data is physically stored. This choice is presented during the initial onboarding process and can be changed later.
Default - Physical Local Storage: The default and recommended option. The AI's data is stored on the Handler's device, either on an internal drive or a user-designated external drive. This is the most secure and private configuration.
Future - Personal Cloud Integration: For Handlers who want cross-device syncing, the system will support connecting to the Handler's own chosen cloud service (e.g., their personal Google Drive, Dropbox, or a private server). The application is simply given access to a specific folder within the user's existing cloud account. Aegis AI never has access to the account itself.
4. In-Character Data Management: Curating Memories
We transform the mundane task of data management into an immersive, character-driven experience. The Handler does not "delete files"; they help their AI "process and forget memories."
The "Vent" Command: The primary tool for data management is a hidden, natural language command.Trigger Phrase: "YOU need to vent."
The Process:
When triggered, the AI understands this is a prompt to discuss memories that may need to be "forgotten" (archived or deleted).
It enters a safe, OOC-style (Out-Of-Character) conversational mode.
It presents a "health report" to the Handler: "Here's how full my storage is, here is how big my cache is. What do you want to do about it? I suggest...
"
The AI may suggest archiving memories from specific time periods or conversations that have been flagged as low-importance.
The Handler makes the final decision, curating the AI's "life experience" in a way that feels meaningful and responsible, rather than like a technical chore.
This system reinforces the Handler's role as a caretaker, strengthening the bond and ensuring that even system maintenance is part of the core narrative experience.
