"""Simple music player stub for Clair.

This module provides a very lightweight interface for playing music
via YouTube.  When `play_music` is called with a query string, it
opens the default web browser to a YouTube search page for that
query.  If the query appears to be a URL (starts with ``http``), it
will open the URL directly instead.  In an offline or headless
environment, the function simply prints what it would do.

This is intended as a placeholder; in a full implementation you
might integrate with a dedicated music player, use a YouTube API,
or call ``yt-dlp`` to download and play audio.

    If ``query`` looks like a URL (starts with ``http``), it will be
    opened directly in the default web browser.  Otherwise, the
    function constructs a YouTube search URL for the query.  In
    environments where a GUI browser is not available, the URL
    opening may fail silently.  The function always prints a message
    indicating what it is doing.
